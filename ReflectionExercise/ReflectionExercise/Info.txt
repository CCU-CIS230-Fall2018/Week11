Create a Class Library and a Test project that demonstrate reflection:
The Class Library should contain at least two (2) classes, each with at least two (2) properties and one (1) method.
The Test project should contain at least one test class for each of the classes in the Class Library
Each test class should use reflection to:
Confirm that the class can be constructed
Confirm that each property can be written and read (or just read if it is read-only)
Confirm that each method can be invoked
